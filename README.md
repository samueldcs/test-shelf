# TestShelf

---

A simple Angular project to explore component and service testing.

I've spent the last year or so using e2e frameworks like Cypress as the only way 
to automatically test the interface and its integrations.

However, the exorbitant cost and fragility of those tests led me to think it might be
wiser to invest in component tests within the front-end module itself and only write
e2e tests as a last resort, following the traditional [test pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html) advice.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server at `http://localhost:4200/`.
